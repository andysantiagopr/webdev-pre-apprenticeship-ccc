When the template literal is evaluated, the expressions inside the placeholders are evaluated and the resulting values are inserted into the string. Template literals can also be used for multi-line strings. In a multi-line string, you can include line breaks and indentation without the need for escape characters. */

//---Arrow Functions---//

/* Arrow functions, also known as "fat arrow functions," are a concise way to write functions in JavaScript.

Arrow functions have a simpler and more compact syntax compared to traditional function expressions, making them easier to read and write.

Arrow functions also have some unique features, such as implicit returns and lexical scoping, which can make them more powerful and flexible than traditional functions in some cases. They are especially useful for writing small, one-line functions, and for passing functions as arguments to higher-order functions.

                                                (parameters) => {function body}

//---Set---//

/* Like Arrays and Objects, Sets are used to store a collection of values. A Set is an object that allows you to store unique values of any type, whether it be primitive values like strings, numbers, or booleans, or object references. Each value can only occur once in a set, so there are no duplicates. This is important in cases where you need to ensure that each value is unique, such as when working with user data or database records. Sets also allow for faster data lookup and efficient data storage. */

/* In JavaScript, a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when the first function completes its task. The purpose of using callbacks is to allow asynchronous operations, where the program can continue executing while it waits for an operation to complete.

Callbacks are commonly used to handle events, such as mouse clicks or keyboard input, or to perform asynchronous operations, such as loading data from a server or writing to a file. When the operation completes, the callback function is executed, allowing the program to continue with the next task.

Callbacks can be defined as named functions or anonymous functions. Named functions are functions that are defined with a name and can be called multiple times from different parts of the code. Anonymous functions are functions that are defined without a name and are typically used for one-time operations, such as passing a function as an argument to another function.

Callbacks are widely used in JavaScript, and they provide a flexible and powerful mechanism for handling asynchronous operations and events. However, they can also lead to callback hell, a situation where nested callbacks can become difficult to read and maintain. */

/*n JavaScript, a promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises allow you to write asynchronous code that is more readable, maintainable, and less error-prone than using traditional callback-based approaches.

A promise has three states:

Pending: The initial state. The promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
Fulfilled: The promise has completed successfully, and the resulting value is available.
Rejected: The promise has failed, and the reason for the failure is available.
Promises have two main methods for interacting with them:

.then(): This method is used to handle a fulfilled promise. It takes a callback function as its argument, which is called with the resulting value of the fulfilled promise.
.catch(): This method is used to handle a rejected promise. It takes a callback function as its argument, which is called with the reason for the rejection. */

//---Async/Await---//

/* Async/await is a way to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous way. It is built on top of Promises, and it makes it easier to write code that looks similar to synchronous code.

Async/await is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves more like synchronous code.

Async functions return a Promise and allow you to use the await keyword to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved or rejected. When an await expression is encountered, the function is paused and control is returned to the event loop. The event loop continues to run other JavaScript code while the async function waits for the Promise to be resolved or rejected.

Once the Promise is resolved, the value is returned to the await expression, and the async function resumes its execution. If the Promise is rejected, an error is thrown, which can be caught using a try-catch block.

By using async/await, you can write asynchronous code that is easier to read and understand, as it appears more like synchronous code. However, it's important to note that async/await is built on top of Promises, so it's important to have a good understanding of Promises before using async/await. */

//---Try / Catch / Finally---//

/* In JavaScript, try-catch-finally is a feature used for error handling. It allows you to write code that attempts to execute a block of code and handle any errors that may occur during its execution.

Try-catch-finally is a control structure in JavaScript that allows you to handle errors in your code. The structure consists of three parts:

try block: This is where you place the code that might generate an error. If an error occurs in this block, it will be caught by the catch block.
catch block: This is where you handle the error that was thrown in the try block. The catch block takes an error object as a parameter, which you can use to access information about the error.
finally block: This block is optional and runs regardless of whether an error was thrown in the try block or caught in the catch block. It's typically used to clean up resources, such as closing files or network connections, that were opened in the try block. */

//---Scope---//

/* Scope refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables and functions within a program. In JavaScript, there are two types of scope: global scope and local scope. Global scope refers to variables and functions that are accessible throughout the entire program, while local scope refers to variables and functions that are accessible only within a specific function or block of code.

In addition, JavaScript has a feature called "lexical scoping", which means that the scope of a variable is determined by its location in the source code. This means that a variable declared in an outer function can be accessed by an inner function, but not vice versa.

Understanding scopes is important in JavaScript programming because it helps prevent naming collisions and unexpected behavior caused by accessing variables and functions from the wrong scope. */

//---Hoisting---//

/* Hoisting, on the other hand, is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes before the code is executed. This means that you can access a variable or function before it has been declared, as long as it is declared somewhere in the same scope. It's important to note that only variable and function declarations are hoisted, not their assignments or initializations. */

//---Rounding methods in JS---//

function calculateSphereVolume(radius) { 
let math = (4/3) * PI * radius **3;

return parseFloat(rounded); //Used the parseFloat(var) method to convert into an int
}

//---Paradigms---//

/* A programming paradigm is a fundamental style or approach to writing computer programs that reflects a particular way of thinking about and solving problems. It is a set of principles, concepts, and techniques that guide the design, implementation, and organization of software systems.

Each programming paradigm has its own unique characteristics and benefits, as well as limitations and trade-offs. For example, procedural programming focuses on breaking down a problem into smaller steps and using functions to solve them, while object-oriented programming emphasizes encapsulating data and behavior within objects that interact with each other. */

//Imperative Programming//

/* This paradigm is based on the concept of giving the computer a set of instructions to follow in a specific order. The focus is on describing how the program should achieve its goals. */

//Functional Programming//

/* This paradigm is based on the use of functions that take inputs and produce outputs without changing any state or variables. The focus is on describing what the program should achieve, rather than how. */

//Object Oriented Programming (OOP)//

/* This paradigm is based on the use of objects that contain data and methods to manipulate that data. The focus is on organizing the code around the objects in the problem domain.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript involves creating objects that have properties and methods, which can then be used to interact with and modify the object.*/

//Procedural programming//

/* This paradigm is similar to imperative programming, but with a focus on dividing the program into reusable procedures or functions.

Procedural programming in JavaScript involves writing a sequence of procedures, or functions, that operate on data.*/

//Declarative Programming//

/* Declarative programming in JavaScript involves expressing what you want to accomplish rather than how to accomplish it. 

//Event-Driven Programming//

Event-driven programming in JavaScript involves responding to user actions or system events.

//Parallel Programming//

Parallel programming in JavaScript involves executing multiple tasks or processes simultaneously to improve performance. */
